## Lab ##

working_array = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

# Assign `20` to the end of the array using the array's length.

# Access the 3rd element from the end of the array.

# Access element 9 from the array

# Assign `[-12, -49]` to the 5th element from the end.

# Access all the elements starting at index 1.

## Bonus ##
# In bin/lab.rb use a block initializer with Array.new to create
# a Ruby Array with ten elements where elements are equal to their
# index multiplied by 2. Store the result and display it on the
# console with puts <array name>.
